# A short story created by crazy people.

### _Follow the rules of improv: Accept the premise and start with 'yes and'_

In a distant land called Geltiba a group of around 20 individuals decided to change their lives. To do so they embarked on a journey together where many challenges, but also many opportunities, await for them. In the beginning they got familiarized with one other and their new tools and one could feel the excitment in the air as they helped and supported each other.

But the excitment, jovial and somewhat naive attitude would soon give way for less dignified feelings as the first problems were just beyond the horizon...

The group woke up after a long night of progrmaming and noticed that the sun had risen only to be coloured blood red. Every was taken aback, but one of the misfits had a feeling this was a long time coming.

And then something unexpected happened to the the surprise of all...

But it wasn't a problem for these enthusiastic up-starts. Sure, the moon was a LITTLE scary, but they'd faced worse. They'd battled the monotony of first-day-admin. They fought off the terminal. They EVEN endured the beastly BeCode button. Though, this GIT... This GIT was something else!
