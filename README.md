### _Follow the rules of improv: Accept the premise and start with 'yes and'_

In a distant land called Geltiba a group of around 20 individuals decided to change their lives. To do so they embarked on a journey together where many challenges, but also many opportunities, await for them. In the beginning they got familiarized with one other and their new tools and one could feel the excitment in the air as they helped and supported each other.

But the excitment, jovial and somewhat naive attitude would soon give way for less dignified feelings as the first problems were just beyond the horizon... And they arrived one after one and very quickly...

All individuals worked as one and managed to solve the problem after problem having their main goal in mind... And looked just fine, but then something terrible happened...
